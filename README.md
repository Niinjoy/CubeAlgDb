# cube-alg-to-notion

Sync Rubik's Cube algorithms from [SpeedCubeDb](https://www.speedcubedb.com/) to Notion.

Here is my [demo page](https://www.notion.so/niin/CFOP-in-Notion-d04da40eb88f48f58ea02165ba4b0eef). If you don't want to store data by your own, you can just visit this page, or duplicate any linked database (firstly click `open as page` on the top right corner) in this page to customize views. More details can be found on the demo page.

## Functions

- Algorithms, their ranks, and you favorite list are synced from SpeedCubeDb to Notion use this project. 

- Manage the algorithms you learnt by manually click checkbox property `learnt` in Notion database.

- Full control of the properties and views to be shown in Notion.

## Build your own

- Fork this project.

- Duplicate the [demo page](https://www.notion.so/niin/CFOP-in-Notion-d04da40eb88f48f58ea02165ba4b0eef).

- Add an [integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) to control this page (contains two databases).

- Put the API key and page id of the two databases into `.env-example`, and change the file name into `.env`.

- Run `getData.py` to get algorithms data with their ranks.

- For "My Algorithm Sheet" data, make sure it is public shared on SpeedCubeDb, like [mine](https://speedcubedb.com/algsheet/1952). Get your id and change it in `getFave.js`. Run `getFave.js` by `node getFave.js` to get your favorite list data.

- Run `index.js` by `node index.js` to update your data.

- If you want to include other algorithms other than "F2L", "OLL", "PLL", you will also need to do several things before running the programs for initialization:

    - Add the name of the algorithm set to `algsets` array in `getData.py` and `getFave.js`, and run this two files. I don't promise there will be no error.

    - Run `getImg.py` to get the image for each cases by [VisualCube](http://cube.rider.biz/visualcube.php). You may want to change views to whatever you like.

    - Uncomment `await createInit(caseDbData)` in `index.js` and run it. After initialization, you should comment this line again.
